This is an Encouraging Mirror Application.
It is used on android based tablets or cellphones.
It detects moods, counts how many smiles seen, and cycles through encouraging statements. 
It is meant to be used behind a two way acrylic mirror.
This was built from Hannah Mitt's smart mirror open source application, but removed many features and altered code to suit
Encouraging mirror Project.
Contributors to Encouragin Mirror App Are Sally Wei, Mary Edwards, Aleksei Zhurankou, and Hannah Mei.
